"""
T1 Isolation export — one workbook per ISO device, selected tags split 40 per sheet.

Layout (per selected device ISO1…ISO12):

    ISO{n}_Report.xlsx
     ├── Tags_1_40      (Timestamp + selected tags 1–40)
     ├── Tags_41_80     (Timestamp + selected tags 41–80)
     ├── Tags_81_120
     └── …              (continues until every SELECTED tag is written)

Only the tags selected in the UI (`req.tags`) are exported — in the order the UI
sent them — so the Excel column set always matches the selection 1:1.

Production-grade PARALLEL STREAMING export
------------------------------------------
Devices are built **concurrently** by a thread pool (`_MAX_WORKERS`), each worker on
its own pooled DB connection, and the result is **streamed to the client as each
device finishes**:

  * One selected device  → its `.xlsx` is streamed in chunks.
  * Several selected      → a ZIP is streamed entry-by-entry — as each device
                            workbook COMPLETES it is written into the archive and its
                            compressed bytes are flushed to the HTTP response
                            immediately, then discarded (ZIP-as-completed).

Per device the selected tags are read in ONE query (server-side-cursor batched at
10k rows, only the requested columns — never SELECT *), then split into 40-tag
sheets. Rendering is delegated to the shared `report_excel` service (company header,
dark theme, unit-labelled bold headers, borders, frozen header row, auto-filter,
auto-fit columns, DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS timestamps, 3-decimal numbers) so the report
format/layout is byte-identical to before. Up to `_MAX_WORKERS` devices are in
flight at once (memory is bounded to that many device row-sets); their SQL reads
overlap. Per-device and total benchmarks (SQL time, Excel time, rows/s) are logged.
