# app/services/intervals.py
"""
Single source of truth for interval / aggregation behaviour.

SCADA rule: **instant telemetry is never aggregated.** A 1-minute interval is the
plant's native sample rate, so it is served as raw records straight from the table.
Every coarser interval buckets the raw samples and aggregates them (Average by
default).

Import `is_instant()` / `effective_agg()` here instead of re-testing the interval
string — that check used to be duplicated across the repository, the merged-page
service, and each Excel exporter, which is how they drift apart.
