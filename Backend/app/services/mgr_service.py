"""
Monthly Generation Report (MGR) — sourced directly from [dbo].[INVERTER_DAILY_GEN].

Each INVERTER_xx_GEN column is a per-inverter energy counter (kWh) that accumulates
through the day and resets to 0 at midnight. A day's generation for an inverter is
therefore that day's MAX of its column, and its monthly generation is the sum of
those daily maxima.

Both figures the page needs come from ONE aggregated query over the month:
  • per-inverter monthly generation = SUM over days of the day's MAX
  • plant generation per day        = SUM across inverters of that day's MAX

The query is a single clustered-index range scan on TimeCol, grouped by date, so it
returns at most 31 rows regardless of how many raw samples the month contains.
The inverter columns are discovered from the live schema — never hardcoded.
