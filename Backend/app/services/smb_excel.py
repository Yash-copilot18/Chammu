"""
String Combiner (SMB) export — data access + per-inverter sheet production.

Layout — ONE workbook per inverter, with ONE worksheet per String Combiner (SMB).
Each inverter's columns are split by their SCB index onto their own tab, so every
SMB reads as its own self-contained report (Timestamp + only that SMB's columns):

    INV1.xlsx                 INV2.xlsx
     ├── SMB1                   ├── SMB1
     ├── SMB2                   ├── SMB2
     │   …                      │   …
     └── SMB21                  └── SMB18

Every worksheet is built from row 1 by `report_excel.write_report_sheet_streaming`
on a freshly created worksheet object: the same report title + equipment metadata
block, one header row and its own SMB's data. No row index, style, print setting or
worksheet state carries over between tabs.

The columns come dynamically from the UI selection — there is no predefined column
list. They are grouped onto tabs strictly by the SCB<n>_ prefix each column carries
(the SMB count is whatever the inverter actually has), UI order preserved within
each tab and no column ever dropped or reordered. Selected tags that do not exist in
the table are logged as an ERROR and simply produce no column, so the exported
columns always equal the selected tags that the inverter genuinely has.

A single selected inverter returns its `INV{n}.xlsx`; several inverters return a ZIP
of per-inverter workbooks (the SMB1/SMB2/… tab names would collide inside one
combined workbook).

Print layout: A4 landscape with the header row repeated down the pages and the
Timestamp column repeated across them. A table this wide necessarily prints across
many pages; scale-to-fit is not attempted because it would be illegible.

Rendering is delegated to the shared `report_excel` service — this module only
discovers/​fetches SCB columns and yields sheet-specs, so there is a SINGLE Excel
code path across the whole Reports module.

Performance: inverters are fetched CONCURRENTLY (lean query per table — only the
required SCB columns, no COUNT, batched reads for large datasets). Each inverter is
queried ONCE and that row set feeds all of its SMB sections; sheets stream into one
XlsxWriter constant-memory workbook, so memory stays flat.

        Reports\\String Combiner\\INV1.xlsx, INV2.xlsx, … INV24.xlsx

    Each INV{n}.xlsx has ONE worksheet per String Combiner — named SMB1, SMB2, …
    SMB{k} (SCBs discovered dynamically per inverter) — and each SMB sheet holds ALL of
    that SCB's columns (plus Timestamp). No Part1/Part2 splitting, no 40-column
    splitting. Filenames, sheet names, headers, filters, formatting and data are
    UNCHANGED — every file is rendered by the SAME `_build_inverter_workbook` the
    browser export uses. Each inverter is read ONCE (in parallel) and reused across
    all of its SMB sheets — the existing performance optimizations are preserved.

    Returns {"directory", "folder_name", "saved":[…], "count", "sheets",
             "excel_seconds", "total_seconds"}.

# ── Per-SCB folder export → D:\SMB\INV{n}\SCB{k}.xlsx ────────────────────────────
# NEW export organisation (client requirement) that leaves the existing combined
# workbook export completely untouched. One Excel file per String Combiner, grouped
# into a folder per inverter:

# across inverters, never a fixed count). Each SCB file's content — company header,
# Equipment Type/ID, From/To/Interval/Aggregation, unit-labelled bold headers, styles,
# 3-decimal numbers, DD/MM/YYYY timestamps — is produced by the SAME
# `report_excel.build_workbook_streaming` writer as the combined export, so a given
# SCB's columns are byte-for-byte identical to that SCB's slice in the old workbook.
